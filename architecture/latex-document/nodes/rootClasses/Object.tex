\className{Object}
\\ \hline
\data{objectID}

\desc{every object needs an ID to be tracable in map and in state}

\data{shapeClass shape}

\data{positionClass position}

\desc{position of an anchor point regardless of shape}
\\ \hline
\method{offspringObjects=evolve(delta-t)}

\desc{changes the state}

\desc{offsprings are the possibly created objects. How these possibly imaginary objects interact with the world and how long they live is not an architectural concern}

\desc{pass for a trivial evolution. Otherwise, the object requires  information. For instance, intersection with other objects. What to pass to evolve()?}

\method{visualize()}

\desc{returns the information required for graphics
boundingBox()}

\desc{simply calls that of the shape? TBD. if world needs shape, we can omit this anyway}

\method{dumpState()}

\desc{return value must have the objectID + a list of states. Maybe with variables names and values. All textual}
