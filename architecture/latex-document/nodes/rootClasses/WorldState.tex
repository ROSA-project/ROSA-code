\desc{the simulator works in delta-t steps. A worldState can be recorded either before or after evolution of all the objects. A partial worldState is invalid unless every object state is flagged as completed or not. The reason is that the world cannot be initialized with a snapshot of a partially completed worldState without knowing which objects have already evolved in that snapshot.}
